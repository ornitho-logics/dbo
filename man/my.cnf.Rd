\usage{
my.cnf(delete = FALSE)
}

\item{delete}{Logical scalar. If `TRUE`, deletes the config file at
`getOption("dbo.my.cnf")`. Defaults to `FALSE`.}
}

}
\description{
Create (if missing), open for editing, or delete a `my.cnf`
containing database credential groups for different hosts.
}
\details{
The location of the config file is read from `options(dbo.my.cnf)`.
}
\note{
If you also use a `my.cnf` with CLI tools that support `--defaults-group-suffix`,
ensure any `[name]` group is duplicated as `[clientname]` so both group names work.
